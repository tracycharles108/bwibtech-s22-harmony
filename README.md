# BWIB Tech Spring 2022 Project: Harmony

In Spring 2022, Bruin Women in Business (BWIB) Tech Committee worked on a project to design a hypothetical mental health app for people struggling with loneliness. I helped lead brainstorm sessions and organize ideas, but the project is a joint effort between Tech board members and committee members. The credit thus also belongs to Chesca Legaspi, Alisha Dhar, Wiona Tan, Gayatri Puppala, Glenda May, Heidi Leuthold, Kaitlyn Li, Kristen Ng, Lauren Hylander, Lisbeth Flores, Rose Aguilar, Sydney Ngao, and Victoria Aye.

Our deliverables of the project are:
- Final presentation slides for Committee Showcase
- Product Requirements Document
- Figma prototype, linked here: https://www.figma.com/proto/YcL0bDnJdfxlPWaVS7qNX3/Chat-App-Homepage-Design-(Community)-(Copy)?node-id=3979-2316&scaling=scale-down&page-id=3975%3A673&starting-point-node-id=3975%3A851

The slides and PRD are attached in this repo.
